= Can I change how my feed is displayed? =

Yes! You can use the content display options within the settings page. Head to Steem Hype > Settings > Content. From here you’ll see many options to be able to change the way the content from Steemit is displayed. The content options are broken down into three areas, Content, Layout and Image.

Content is where you can edit the actual content that is pulled through, show or hide elements from the steemit feed, and set character limits on that content.

Layout changes the way the feed is presented. You can choose to edit the size of the text that is displayed and also the style – there are two options to choose from, card or list.

List Layout: Steemit feed image is located at the left part, and the body is located at the right part.
Card Layout: Steemit feed image is located at the top, and the body is located at the bottom.

Image settings allow you to show or hide the image and then choose a small or large image size to display.

To save your changes, remember to click the green tick box.
